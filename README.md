Elevator Control System Using Verilog
This project is an elevator control system implemented using Verilog. It controls the elevator's movements and operations based on user inputs and current state. Key features include:

Inputs:
clk, reset
up_button, down_button, door_hold_button
desired_floor (4-bit), emergency_stop

Outputs:
floor (4-bit), energy_saving_mode
door_hold_active, display_panel (3-bit)

Functionality:
Moves the elevator up or down based on button presses
Stops at the desired floor and in emergencies
Activates energy-saving mode and door hold function
Updates the display panel to show the current floor
This project demonstrates practical digital design and hardware control using Verilog. The repository includes the complete Verilog code, simulation test benches, and detailed documentation.
